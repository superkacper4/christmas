# Santa letters
This app helps you to write your Santa letter :)

## General info
I felt christmas vibes and decided to do something what will fit in and I made this. I didn't know what exactly will be in this project (you can see it even in repo name, becouse it is called christmas not Santa Claus or something), but finally it ended here. You can write your letter and then save it in PDF. Project was made quickly and I even didn't make configuration (ESlint etc.), because it was kind of spontaneous
